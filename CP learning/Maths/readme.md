### 1. Birthday Paradox
What is the probability that two persons among n have same birthday?
[Ans](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/birthday-paradox/)   

### 2. Brute force
a programming style, one in which the programmer relies on the computer's processing power instead of using his or her own intelligence to simplify the problem. (straightforward approach)
problems like find the sum of all element in the array. or simple math calculation formula

### 3. Big Integer
For example factorial of 100 contains 158 digits in it so we can’t store it in any primitive data type available. To solve this issue we can use Java's Big Int class. [link](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/biginteger-class-in-java/)
Or we can use arrays in c++ with some logic. For calculating big factorial use [this](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/factorial-large-number/)

### 4. Modular Arithmetic Properties
we need to print the answer modulo M, most often M=10^9+7

### 5. Catalan Number
Catalan numbers are a sequence of natural numbers that occurs in many interesting counting problems. Seq=  1, 1, 2, 5, 14, 42, 132, 429, 1430, 4862, … . [Code and explanation](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/program-nth-catalan-number/)
